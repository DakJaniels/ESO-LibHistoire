--- Creates a legacy listener object which emulates the old guild history api. See guildHistoryCache/GuildHistoryLegacyEventListener.lua for details.
--- It's highly recommended to transition to CreateGuildHistoryProcessor instead, to take better advantage of the new history api.

--- Utility function to convert id64s that have been artificially created by a legacy listener to the new id53 equivalent.
--- Should be used one time only to convert all id64s that have been stored by the addon when switching to the new event processor api, since it's not the fastest operation.
--- @param id64 string The id64 to convert.
--- @return integer53|nil id53 The converted id53 or nil if the id64 cannot be converted.
